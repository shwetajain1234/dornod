# Project 1 - Deal or No Deal

### Introduction
This was the very first project that I did in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. The brief for this project was to create a simple game using HTML, CSS, Javascript. That was all that we learnt at that point in the course (2 Weeks into the course.)

I decided to create a simple Deal or no Deal game. Deal or No Deal is a popular syndicated TV show, and I decided to put what I learnt to the test to create the game.

I also used a rudimentary implementation of Bootstrap, in the sense that my bootstrap skills were not fantastic at this point in the course, but I tried to implement it as much as I could to expose myself to the library.

### Installation
To download the game and recreate it on your local machine, you have to undertake the following steps.
1. Fork/Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html and you will be able to play the game.

### Further Notes
If you wish to use the code in your own implementation of the game, please feel free to follow the code. Should you have any further questions on the implementation or certain aspects of the game, feel free to message me or drop me a mail.
